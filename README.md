# AutoService - Appointment and Resource Management System

AutoService is a full-stack application using ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend, React + TypeScript for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. The system runs on a .NET Aspire orchestration layer to simplify local development, observability, and container-based workflows.

## Copilot Skills (Quick Use)

Detailed agent policies are maintained as skills and prompts.

- `/mcp-context-policy` → MCP server usage and Context Mode interaction policy.
- `/config-driven-endpoints` → Fixed config-driven ports/URLs policy, no hardcoded endpoint fallback.
- `/ef-migration` → EF migration workflow and troubleshooting runbook.

Skill sources:

- `.github/skills/autoservice-mcp-context-policy/SKILL.md`
- `.github/skills/autoservice-config-driven-endpoints/SKILL.md`
- `.github/skills/autoservice-ef-migration/SKILL.md`

## Authentication (High Level)

- Authentication is based on ASP.NET Core Identity + JWT, with backend-managed HttpOnly cookie sessions.
- Access and refresh tokens are stored in secure HttpOnly cookies, with refresh token rotation and server-side persistence (hashed).
- Auth endpoints currently exposed: `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/refresh`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/validate`.
- Dashboard access is for mechanics only.
- Sensitive operational/security details are intentionally not published in this README.

## Run with Aspire

```Bash
cd AutoServiceApp
cd AutoService.AppHost
dotnet run
```

This starts the orchestrated local environment (API + infrastructure + related services).
