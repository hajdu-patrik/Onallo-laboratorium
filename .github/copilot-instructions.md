# AutoService Copilot Instructions (Project-Specific)

## Goal
This repository hosts the AutoService full-stack application.

Prioritize maintainable, domain-safe, incremental changes that align with the existing architecture and folder layout.

## Technology Baseline
- Backend: .NET 10 (C# 15) ASP.NET Core Web API + Entity Framework Core.
- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS only.
- Orchestration: .NET Aspire (`AutoService.AppHost` + `AutoService.ServiceDefaults`).
- Database target: PostgreSQL via Aspire orchestration.

## Repository Map
- `AutoServiceApp/AutoService.ApiService`: API, domain model, EF Core context and migrations.
- `AutoServiceApp/AutoService.AppHost`: Aspire orchestration entry point.
- `AutoServiceApp/AutoService.ServiceDefaults`: shared defaults and cross-service settings.
- `AutoServiceApp/AutoService.WebUI`: React client.

## Team Coordination Rule (Merge-Conflict Prevention)
- If someone starts working in a shared or high-churn area, they should post a short note in the team group first (scope + expected files).
- For parallel work, prefer folder-level ownership during a work window (for example, one person on `ApiService/Auth`, another on `WebUI/src`).
- Before pushing larger changes, sync in the group to avoid simultaneous edits on the same files.

## MCP and Hook Policy (Workspace)
- Keep MCP server setup intentionally minimal and project-focused.
- Primary servers for this repository:
	- `pencil-design-tool`
	- `context-mode`
- Optional server when Aspire workflow support is needed:
	- `aspire` (use workspace-local tool via `dotnet tool run aspire -- mcp start`)
- Do **not** add extra MCP servers unless they clearly reduce repeated manual work for this project.
- MCP server workspace config file: `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- Hook config file for context-mode lifecycle integration: `.github/hooks/context-mode.json`.
- Default workflow: treat context-mode as automatic routing/enforcement. Do not require explicit context-mode prompts for routine small tasks.
- Prefer explicit context-mode tool usage when output can be large (long logs, broad searches, large API/CLI output, large docs/web content).
- For multi-step research, prefer batching/indexing patterns (`ctx_batch_execute`, indexing + search) over many separate high-output calls.
- After editing MCP/hook config, restart VS Code to ensure hooks and routing instructions are reloaded.

## Copilot Skill Entry Points
- Use `/mcp-context-policy` for MCP server interaction policy and Context Mode usage decisions.
- Use `/config-driven-endpoints` for URL/port changes to enforce config-driven addressing and avoid hardcoded fallback endpoints.
- Use `/ef-migration` for EF migration execution and troubleshooting.
- Keep README usage references concise; detailed policy/workflow logic belongs in skill files under `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`.

## Configuration-First Addressing Rule
- Keep local ports and service endpoints in configuration files; do not hardcode runtime fallback URLs.
- For service endpoint changes, update the relevant config sources consistently:
	- `AutoServiceApp/AutoService.AppHost/appsettings.json` (ports)
	- `AutoServiceApp/AutoService.ApiService/Properties/launchSettings.json` (API local URL)
	- `AutoServiceApp/AutoService.WebUI/.env.development` (WebUI local env)
- Keep frontend API base URL environment-driven (`VITE_API_URL`) and avoid code-level localhost fallback.
- When adding new services, define addresses in config first, then wire via Aspire/environment injection.

## Backend Non-Negotiables
- Keep `People` inheritance as TPH (Table-Per-Hierarchy) at all times.
- Keep `People` as abstract base and keep `Customer` + `Mechanic` as derived entities.
- Keep one `people` table with discriminator; do not switch to TPT or TPC.
- Keep authentication based on ASP.NET Core Identity with `IdentityUser`; do not replace the domain `People` model with Identity entities.
- Link the domain model to Identity through `People.IdentityUserId`; do not duplicate password or credential fields on `People`, `Customer`, or `Mechanic`.
- Preserve `FullName` as an owned value object mapping on `People`.
- Preserve mechanic expertise rules:
	- expertise list must contain 1..10 items,
	- items must be unique,
	- persisted expertise must never be empty.
- Preserve core relationships:
	- `Customer` 1..* `Vehicle`,
	- `Vehicle` 1..* `Appointment`,
	- `Appointment` *..* `Mechanic` (join table).
- Do not expose EF entities directly from API boundaries; use DTO contracts.

## EF Core and Data Rules
- The EF Core provider is `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`; use `options.UseNpgsql(...)` in `Program.cs`.
- Keep model configuration centralized in `Data/AutoServiceDbContext.cs`.
- Place new migrations in `Data/Migrations`.
- Current migrations: `InitialCreate` + `AddIdentityAndIdentityUserId`.
- `DemoDataInitializer.EnsureSeededAsync()` runs on startup: calls `MigrateAsync()` then seeds mechanics (with Identity accounts) and customers (plain records) when tables are empty.
- Prefer async EF methods for I/O (`SaveChangesAsync`, `ToListAsync`, etc.).
- Keep schema constraints and indexes aligned with domain invariants.
- Use `ConnectionStrings:AutoServiceDb` as the canonical connection key.
- Never hardcode credentials in committed source code.
- Prefer Aspire-injected configuration, environment variables, and gitignored local overrides.
- Local standalone run (outside AppHost): provide the PostgreSQL connection string in `appsettings.Local.json` (gitignored) or via the `ConnectionStrings__AutoServiceDb` environment variable.

## API Implementation Rules
- Keep `Program.cs` focused on service registration, middleware, and endpoint mapping.
- Place cross-cutting logic in dedicated files/folders (for example `Auth`, `Contracts`, extensions).
- Keep auth endpoint mapping in dedicated auth files under `AutoService.ApiService/Auth`.
- Prefer splitting oversized auth endpoint implementations into focused files (map/register/login/helpers/contracts) under `AutoService.ApiService/Auth`.
- Configure authentication with ASP.NET Core Identity + JWT Bearer; read the signing secret from `JwtSettings:Secret`.
- Only **mechanics** can register and log in; **customers are passive domain records** (vehicle owners, notification targets) with no login account and no `IdentityUserId`.
- Keep registration logic transactional: create `IdentityUser` and linked `Mechanic` domain record together, linked by `People.IdentityUserId`.
- Login/refresh/logout endpoints should verify credentials/session through Identity + persisted refresh tokens and maintain HttpOnly cookie auth state.
- Keep JWT secrets out of committed config; use `appsettings.Local.json`, environment variables, or user secrets.
- For local auth testing outside AppHost, keep `JwtSettings:Secret` in `appsettings.Local.json` (gitignored) or use the `JwtSettings__Secret` environment variable.
- Use cancellation tokens for async flows where applicable.
- Return accurate HTTP status codes and explicit validation errors.
- Keep comments concise and only for non-obvious logic.

## Current API & Security Snapshot (Keep In Sync With Code)
- Current mapped endpoints in `AutoService.ApiService`:
	- `POST /api/auth/register`
	- `POST /api/auth/login` (rate-limited by policy `AuthLoginAttempts`)
	- `POST /api/auth/refresh`
	- `POST /api/auth/logout` (authorized)
	- `GET /api/auth/validate` (authorized)
	- `GET /openapi/v1.json` in Development (`app.MapOpenApi()`)
- No `Customer`, `Vehicle`, or `Appointment` CRUD endpoints are currently mapped.
- Auth and login behavior currently implemented:
	- registration is mechanic-only,
	- login accepts email or phone number,
	- email inputs are trimmed and normalized to lowercase,
	- Hungarian phone inputs accept common formats (`+36`, `36`, `06`, spaces/punctuation) and normalize to canonical `36xxxxxxxxx`,
	- register rejects duplicate phone numbers even if input format differs,
	- unknown/wrong credentials return generic `401` (`invalid_credentials`),
	- lockout is enabled (`5` failed attempts, `15` minutes lockout),
	- login rate limit is `10` requests per minute per client IP,
	- temporary login ban window after rate-limit rejection is currently `3` minutes,
	- access token lifetime is currently `10` minutes,
	- refresh token lifetime is currently `7` days,
	- access and refresh tokens are stored in HttpOnly cookies,
	- refresh tokens are persisted hashed and rotated on refresh.
- JWT validation requirements currently enforced:
	- signed tokens only,
	- issuer and audience validation enabled,
	- lifetime validation enabled,
	- clock skew set to `1` minute,
	- secret must be configured and at least `32` bytes,
	- access token may be read from cookie,
	- denylised `jti` values are rejected.
- Security middleware currently active:
	- `UseHttpsRedirection()` always,
	- `UseHsts()` outside Development,
	- `UseCors("WebUIPolicy")`,
	- `UseRateLimiter()`, `UseAuthentication()`, `UseAuthorization()`.
- Seeding and credential safety:
	- `DemoDataInitializer` runs migrations on startup,
	- demo seeding outside Development requires `DemoData:EnableSeeding=true`,
	- `DemoData:MechanicPassword` is required when seeding is enabled.

## Current Known Gaps (As Of Current Code)
- `AutoService.ApiService/Contracts` remains minimal and should be expanded as endpoint surface grows.
- `Customer`, `Vehicle`, and `Appointment` CRUD endpoints are still not mapped.
- Frontend currently covers login/dashboard/404 flows only; no domain CRUD UI yet.
- Token denylist is currently in-memory only; horizontal scale/multi-instance deployments need distributed denylist/session invalidation strategy.
- `AutoService.ServiceDefaults` health endpoint extensions exist, but API does not currently call `MapDefaultEndpoints()`.
- No dedicated unit/integration test project exists yet.

## API Test Coverage Snapshot
- `AutoService.ApiService.http` includes an auth full matrix for:
	- register (email-only, email+phone, duplicates, invalid email/phone, invalid person type/expertise),
	- login (email normalization and phone format matrix),
	- cookie session lifecycle (validate/refresh/logout + unauthorized follow-ups),
	- security manual tests for denylist bypass and rotated refresh replay attempts.

## Aspire Rules
- `AutoService.AppHost` is the default local entry point.
- Wire dependencies using `WithReference(...)` and startup ordering with `WaitFor(...)` when needed.
- Frontend must use `VITE_API_URL` provided by AppHost instead of hardcoded API endpoints.
- Keep infrastructure resource names stable and deterministic when adding new resources.

## Frontend Rules
- Use React function components and strict TypeScript.
- Never suggest Next.js or server-side rendering patterns.
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling; avoid new custom CSS unless necessary.
- Use pastel purple as the primary accent color for new UI work.
- Ensure layouts are responsive on desktop and mobile.
- Keep API access logic in `src/services` and keep components focused on UI/state.

## Code Change Policy for Copilot
- Make minimal, task-focused changes; avoid broad refactors unless requested.
- Preserve existing behavior unless the task explicitly asks for behavior changes.
- For backend changes, validate with `dotnet build` from `AutoServiceApp`.
- For frontend changes, validate with `npm run build` from `AutoService.WebUI` when relevant.
- If task requirements conflict with current implementation, follow this file and call out the conflict clearly.

## Preferred Commands
From `AutoServiceApp` root:
- `dotnet build`
- `dotnet run --project AutoService.AppHost`
- `dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project AutoService.ApiService --startup-project AutoService.ApiService --output-dir Data/Migrations`
- `dotnet ef database update --project AutoService.ApiService --startup-project AutoService.ApiService`

From `AutoServiceApp/AutoService.WebUI`:
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
