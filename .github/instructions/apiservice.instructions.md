# AutoService.ApiService Instructions

## Domain Model & Persistence

- Preserve People inheritance as TPH with one people table and discriminator.
- Keep People abstract, with Customer and Mechanic as derived entities.
- Keep Identity linkage through People.IdentityUserId only.
- Keep FullName as owned value object mapping.
- Keep mechanic expertise constraints intact: 1..10 items, unique, non-empty persisted value.
- Keep core relationships:
  - `Customer` 1..* `Vehicle`,
  - `Vehicle` 1..* `Appointment`,
  - `Appointment` *..* `Mechanic` (join table).
- Use DTO contracts at API boundaries, do not expose EF entities directly.
- Prefer async EF methods and cancellation tokens.
- Place new migrations in Data/Migrations.

## Authentication & Security

- Keep auth mechanic-only for registration and login.
- Keep auth registration transactional: IdentityUser + Mechanic domain record in one transaction.
- Keep auth endpoints in Auth folder and avoid expanding Program.cs with endpoint handler logic.
- Prefer splitting large auth endpoint files into focused files in `Auth/` (for example map/register/login/helpers/contracts).
- Keep JWT signing secret externalized (env or local untracked config), minimum 32 bytes.
- Keep login protections: lockout (5 failed attempts, 15 min lockout), rate limit (10 req/min), and temporary ban behavior (3 min) consistent unless explicitly requested.
- Keep auth input normalization consistent across register/login:
  - emails are trimmed + lowercased,
  - Hungarian phone formats (`+36`, `36`, `06`, spaced/punctuated forms) normalize to canonical national form with strict prefix/length rules:
    - `361xxxxxxx` (Budapest),
    - `36(20|21|30|31|50|70)xxxxxxx` (mobile/nomadic),
    - `36<approved 2-digit area>xxxxxx` (geographic).
- Registration must reject duplicate phone numbers even when equivalent values are provided in different formats.
- JWT token lifetime is 10 minutes.
- JWT validation: issuer/audience validation enabled, lifetime validation enabled, clock skew 1 minute.
- Keep cookie auth secure defaults for auth cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite, explicit Path).
- CORS policy must allow explicit WebUI origins with credentials; configure via `Cors:AllowedOrigins`, `builder.Services.AddCors()`, and `app.UseCors()`.

## API Endpoints (Current)

- `POST /api/auth/register` – Mechanic-only registration; returns IdentityUserId + PersonId + PersonType + Email.
- `POST /api/auth/login` – Email or phone + password → sets access + refresh cookies and returns profile info + expiration time.
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` – Rotates refresh token and reissues access cookie.
- `POST /api/auth/logout` – Revokes refresh token session, denylists current JWT `jti`, clears auth cookies.
- `GET /api/auth/validate` – Returns person linkage data for valid authenticated session.
- `POST /api/auth/login` accepts normalized email/phone identifier input and supports backward-compatible phone-in-email field fallback.
- `POST /api/auth/login` failure semantics: generic `401 invalid_credentials` for unknown/wrong credentials, `403 mechanic_only_login` when an existing customer email/phone is used, `429` for lockout/rate-limit, `500` when linked domain record is missing.

### Appointment Endpoints (`/api/appointments`) — all require authorization

- `GET /api/appointments?year=&month=` — List appointments for a given month (defaults to current month if omitted; year: 2000-2100, month: 1-12).
- `GET /api/appointments/today` — List today's UTC-range appointments.
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/claim` — Current mechanic (from JWT `person_id`) claims an unassigned appointment. Returns 409 if already claimed, 422 if cancelled.
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/status` — Update appointment status (requesting mechanic must be assigned). Validates status enum, returns 403 if not assigned.
- Appointment DTOs: `AppointmentDto`, `VehicleDto`, `CustomerSummaryDto`, `MechanicSummaryDto`, `UpdateStatusRequest`.
- Endpoint files follow partial-class pattern in `Appointments/` folder (mirroring `Auth/` structure).

## API Documentation

- OpenAPI spec: `GET /openapi/v1.json` (Development only, via `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`).
- Interactive docs: Scalar API Reference at `/scalar/v1` (Development only, via `Scalar.AspNetCore`).

## Configuration

- Database: PostgreSQL via Aspire (NpgsqlEntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL provider).
- Connection string key: `ConnectionStrings:AutoServiceDb`.
- JWT settings: `JwtSettings:Secret` (min 32 bytes), `JwtSettings:Issuer`, `JwtSettings:Audience`.
- CORS settings: `Cors:AllowedOrigins` (required explicit origins for credentialed cross-origin requests).
- Demo seeding: Outside Development, require `DemoData:EnableSeeding=true` and `DemoData:MechanicPassword`.
- Configuration files:
  - `appsettings.json` – Production defaults.
  - `appsettings.Local.json` – Local overrides (gitignored).
  - Environment variables override both.
- Health endpoints: Call `MapDefaultEndpoints()` in Program.cs when health checks are needed (optional).

## EF Core Rules

- Use `options.UseNpgsql(...)` for PostgreSQL.
- Model configuration centralized in `Data/AutoServiceDbContext.cs`.
- Keep schema constraints and indexes aligned with domain invariants.
- `DemoDataInitializer.EnsureSeededAsync()` runs on startup: calls `MigrateAsync()` then seeds mechanics (with Identity accounts) and customers (plain records) when tables are empty.
