# AutoService.ApiService — Domain & API Rules

## Domain Model Constraints

- `People` is abstract, TPH. Discriminator column on `people` table. Never change to TPT/TPC.
- `FullName` is an owned value object on `People`.
- Identity linkage only via `People.IdentityUserId`. No password/credential fields on `People`, `Customer`, or `Mechanic`.
- `People.ProfilePicture` (`byte[]?`) and `People.ProfilePictureContentType` (`string?`, max 50) — optional binary profile picture storage.
- Mechanic expertise: 1–10 items, unique, never empty when persisted. The `> 10` upper-bound is enforced by `ValidateRegisterRequest` before persistence (returns `422`), not solely by the DB constraint.
- Core relationships:
  - `Customer` 1..* `Vehicle`
  - `Vehicle` 1..* `Appointment`
  - `Appointment` *..*  `Mechanic` (join table)
- `ProgressStatus` enum values: `InProgress`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`. Default on new appointments is `InProgress`.
- `Appointment` entity has `DateTime IntakeCreatedAt`, `DateTime DueDateTime`, `DateTime? CompletedAt`, and `DateTime? CanceledAt`; status transitions auto-set/clear the completion/cancel timestamps.
- `AppointmentDto` includes `IntakeCreatedAt`, `DueDateTime`, `CompletedAt`, and `CanceledAt` fields.
- Never expose EF entities directly from API boundaries — use DTO contracts.

## EF Core

- Provider: `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL` — use `options.UseNpgsql(...)`.
- Model config centralized in `Data/AutoServiceDbContext.cs`.
- New migrations go in `Data/Migrations`.
- Current migrations: `InitialCreate`, `AddIdentityAndIdentityUserId`, `AddRefreshTokensAndCookieAuth`, `AddProfilePicture`, `AddAppointmentTimestamps`, `BackfillDemoData`, `AddAppointmentIntakeAndDueDateTime`, `AddRevokedJwtTokenDenylist`, `NormalizePhoneNumbersToE164`, `PostSecurityPayloadHardening`.
- `DemoDataInitializer.EnsureSeededAsync()` runs on startup: `MigrateAsync()` + ensure Admin role + seed mechanics (with Identity accounts), customers (plain records), vehicles, and appointments when tables are empty. Seeding includes 30 additional generated appointments in the current UTC month (including today and multiple same-day entries).
- Admin role seeding is idempotent and runs on every startup (before the "is data already seeded?" guard), ensuring the `"Admin"` Identity role exists and is assigned to the first mechanic (Gabor Kovacs).
- Legacy migrated/backfilled customer-only states are auto-recovered: if mechanics/identity linkage is missing while customer-side data exists, the initializer resets the inconsistent dataset using explicit EF set-based deletes (`ExecuteDeleteAsync`, no raw `TRUNCATE`) and reseeds deterministic demo data.
- Outside Development, seeding requires `DemoData:EnableSeeding=true` and `DemoData:MechanicPassword`.
- Startup/seeding fails fast if `ConnectionStrings:AutoServiceDb`, `JwtSettings:Secret`, or `DemoData:MechanicPassword` still contains template placeholder markers (for example `CHANGE_ME` or `SET_UNIQUE_LOCAL`, including punctuation-separated variants).
- Prefer async EF methods (`SaveChangesAsync`, `ToListAsync`, etc.) with cancellation tokens.

## Authorization & Roles

- ASP.NET Identity Roles enabled via `.AddRoles<IdentityRole>()`.
- Named policy `"AdminOnly"` requires `ClaimTypes.Role == "Admin"`.
- JWT tokens include role claims via `UserManager.GetRolesAsync()` — added as `ClaimTypes.Role`.
- `CreateJwtTokenAsync` is async and accepts `UserManager<IdentityUser>` to resolve roles.
- Auth responses: `LoginResponse` and `ValidateTokenResponse` return `int PersonId` and `bool IsAdmin` (no other fields); refresh returns `204 No Content` with no response body.

## Auth Implementation

- Mechanic-only registration and login. Customers have no Identity account.
- Registration is admin-only: requires `"AdminOnly"` authorization policy (caller must have `"Admin"` role in JWT).
- Registration is transactional: `IdentityUser` + `Mechanic` domain record created together, linked by `IdentityUserId`.
- Registration pre-checks normalized email collisions against both Identity users and domain `People` records (including passive customers) before account creation.
- Registration maps database unique-constraint email races to the same generic validation response used by duplicate pre-checks (for example `register`) instead of returning a generic server error.
- Name validation (first name, middle name, last name) is enforced at register, profile update, and customer create/update: names may only contain Unicode letters and hyphens (`^[\p{L}\-]+$`). Validation uses `ContactNormalization.IsValidName()` and error messages from `ValidationMessages`.
- Login accepts email or phone number.
- Identifier normalization is mandatory across register/login:
  - emails are trimmed + lowercased,
  - phone inputs normalize to canonical E.164 format (`+{countryCode}{nationalNumber}`),
  - accepted phone numbers must be valid European numbers according to libphonenumber and the backend country-code allowlist.
- Register enforces duplicate phone detection on normalized values, including equivalent formats.
- Auth session model is cookie-based:
  - access token in HttpOnly cookie (`autoservice_at`),
  - refresh token in HttpOnly cookie (`autoservice_rt`),
  - persisted hashed refresh token rows in `refreshtokens`.
- Access-token JWT denylist rows are persisted in `revokedjwttokens` and cached in-memory for fast validation checks.
- `TokenDenylistService.IsRevokedAsync` calls `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` at entry and lets `OperationCanceledException` propagate naturally — no swallowing of cancellation inside the method. The `OnTokenValidated` JWT bearer event catches `OperationCanceledException` only at the call site when `RequestAborted` is set, so a cancelled request cannot treat a revoked JWT as valid.
- Shared TTL constants (`AccessTokenTtl = 10 min`, `RefreshTokenTtl = 7 days`) are declared as `private static readonly TimeSpan` fields in `AuthEndpoints.Helpers.cs` and reused by login, refresh, and cookie-option helpers.
- `BuildAuthCookieOptions(TimeSpan ttl)` is a shared factory method in `AuthEndpoints.Helpers.cs`; `BuildAccessTokenCookieOptions` and `BuildRefreshTokenCookieOptions` delegate to it.
- Auth log events include a `ClientIp` structured property: login success, login failure, and login lockout all log `ClientIp`; refresh success and revoked-token-reuse warning log `ClientIp`. `ResolveClientIpAddress(httpContext)` is computed once per handler and reused (including for the `CreatedByIpAddress` field on new `RefreshToken` DB rows).
- `AuditAccessDeniedMiddleware` (`Middleware/AuditAccessDeniedMiddleware.cs`) emits a `LogWarning` under logger category `Auth.AccessDenied` for every response with status code `401` or `403`. Structured properties: `StatusCode`, `MechanicId` (from `person_id` claim), `Method`, `Path`, `ClientIp` (hashed as `sha256:<12hex>`). Must be registered before `UseAuthentication()`.
- Login failure semantics: generic `401 invalid_credentials` for unknown identifier, wrong password, when a linked mechanic domain record is missing, and for existing customer email/phone identifiers (to reduce account enumeration); `429` during lockout/rate-limit.
- Lockout: 5 failed attempts, 15-minute lockout.
- Rate limit: 10 requests/min per client IP for login (`AuthLoginAttempts`) and 20 requests/min for refresh (`AuthRefreshAttempts`). Temporary login-ban window after login rate-limit rejection: 3 minutes.
- JWT lifetime: 10 minutes. Refresh token lifetime: 7 days.
- JWT clock skew: 30 seconds. Issuer + audience validation enabled. Minimum secret: 32 bytes.
- Logout revokes refresh token session and denylists current JWT `jti` until token expiry.
- CSRF protection strategy: `SameSite=Strict` on all auth cookies provides implicit CSRF mitigation for modern browsers. No explicit CSRF token mechanism is used because `SameSite=Strict` prevents cross-origin cookie attachment in all request scenarios (including top-level navigations). This is sufficient for an API-only backend consumed by a same-origin SPA. Legacy browsers without `SameSite` support are not in scope for this application.
- JWT bearer handler reads access token from cookie and rejects denylised `jti` values.

## Auth Endpoints (Current)

- `POST /api/auth/register` (authorized, AdminOnly policy) — `RegisterResponse` contains `PersonId`, `PersonType`, `Email` only; `IdentityUserId` is not exposed in the response
- `POST /api/auth/login` (rate-limited) — returns `LoginResponse(PersonId, IsAdmin)`
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` (rate-limited) — returns `204 No Content` with no response body
- `POST /api/auth/logout` (authorized)
- `GET /api/auth/validate` (authorized) — returns `ValidateTokenResponse(PersonId, IsAdmin)`

## Appointment Endpoints (Current)

- `GET /api/appointments?year=&month=` (authorized) — list appointments for a month
- `GET /api/appointments/today` (authorized) — list today's appointments
- `POST /api/appointments/intake` (authorized) — create scheduler intake appointment for selected day; validates due datetime, resolves customer by email (create fallback), and for not-found lookups allows intake without manual `CustomerFirstName`/`CustomerLastName` when the email belongs to a mechanic so backend can resolve mechanic-email owner linking via generated customer-owner linkage email and create/use the linked customer record; enforces vehicle numeric max constraints for new-vehicle payloads, and auto-assigns the requesting mechanic
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}` (authorized) — update appointment fields (`dueDateTime`, `taskDescription`); `scheduledDate` is always immutable; allowed for assigned mechanics and admins
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/vehicle` (authorized) — update linked vehicle fields (`licensePlate`, `brand`, `model`, `year`, `mileageKm`, `enginePowerHp`, `engineTorqueNm`); allowed for assigned mechanics and admins
- `POST /api/customers/{customerId}/appointments` (authorized, AdminOnly) — create an appointment for a customer's vehicle with request validation (vehicle ownership, mechanic IDs, task, scheduled date); returns 201 Created
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/claim` (authorized) — current mechanic self-assigns to an appointment only when status is `InProgress`; returns `422` with code `appointment_cancelled` if appointment is Cancelled, or `422` with code `appointment_not_in_progress` for other non-`InProgress` statuses; race-condition uniqueness violations are caught via `PostgresException { SqlState: UniqueViolation }` (not broad `DbUpdateException`)
- `DELETE /api/appointments/{id}/claim` (authorized) — current mechanic self-unassigns from an appointment; returns `422` with code `appointment_cancelled` if appointment is Cancelled, `422` with code `appointment_completed` if appointment is Completed, or `422` if unassign would leave the appointment without mechanics
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/status` (authorized) — update appointment status (assigned mechanic only); auto-sets CompletedAt/CanceledAt timestamps on status change and allows moving Cancelled appointments back to InProgress/Completed (including past-dated appointments)
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/assign/{mechanicId}` (authorized, AdminOnly) — admin assigns a mechanic to an appointment; returns `422` with code `appointment_cancelled` if appointment is Cancelled, `422` with code `appointment_completed` if appointment is Completed; race-condition uniqueness violations are caught via `PostgresException { SqlState: UniqueViolation }` (not broad `DbUpdateException`)
- `DELETE /api/appointments/{id}/assign/{mechanicId}` (authorized, AdminOnly) — admin removes a mechanic from an appointment; returns `422` with code `appointment_cancelled` if appointment is Cancelled, `422` with code `appointment_completed` if appointment is Completed, or `422` if removal would leave the appointment without mechanics
- Group root endpoints are mapped without requiring a trailing slash (for example, `/api/appointments` works directly).

## Customer Endpoints (Current)

- `GET /api/customers` (authorized) — list all customers (id, name, email, phone, vehicle count)
- `GET /api/customers/by-email?email=` (authorized) — scheduler customer lookup by normalized email; returns customer with vehicle list, and mechanic email lookups also succeed for own-car intake even before a linked customer record exists (empty vehicle list)
- `GET /api/customers/{id}` (authorized) — get single customer with vehicle list
- `POST /api/customers` (authorized, AdminOnly) — create customer record (firstName, middleName?, lastName, email, phoneNumber?)
- `PUT /api/customers/{id}` (authorized, AdminOnly) — update customer record
- `DELETE /api/customers/{id}` (authorized, AdminOnly) — delete customer and cascaded vehicles
- Customer DTOs: `CustomerDto`, `CreateCustomerRequest`, `UpdateCustomerRequest`.
- Endpoint files follow partial-class pattern in `Customers/` folder (CustomerEndpoints.cs / Contracts / Queries / Mutations).
- Customers are passive records — no Identity account, no `IdentityUserId`.

## Vehicle Endpoints (Current)

- `GET /api/customers/{customerId}/vehicles` (authorized) — list all vehicles for a customer
- `GET /api/vehicles/{id}` (authorized) — get single vehicle with customer summary
- `POST /api/customers/{customerId}/vehicles` (authorized, AdminOnly) — create vehicle for a customer; license plate normalized to uppercase and validated against supported European formatting rules
- `PUT /api/vehicles/{id}` (authorized, AdminOnly) — update vehicle record with the same European license-plate validation rules
- `DELETE /api/vehicles/{id}` (authorized, AdminOnly) — delete vehicle and cascaded appointments
- Vehicle DTOs: `VehicleDetailDto`, `CustomerSummaryDto`, `CreateVehicleRequest`, `UpdateVehicleRequest`.
- Endpoint files follow partial-class pattern in `Vehicles/` folder (VehicleEndpoints.cs / Contracts / Queries / Mutations).

## Profile Endpoints (Current)

- `GET /api/profile` (authorized) — get current user's profile (name, email, phone, picture status)
- `PUT /api/profile` (authorized) — update email, phone number, first name, middle name, last name
- `DELETE /api/profile` (authorized, non-admin only) — delete current user profile after current-password confirmation (logs out and clears auth cookies). Returns 403 if the caller has the Admin role. `tokenDenylistService.RevokeAsync()` is called before `transaction.CommitAsync()` to ensure the JWT is denylisted atomically with the deletion.
- `POST /api/profile/change-password` (authorized) — change password (current + new + confirm)
- `GET /api/profile/picture` (authorized) — get profile picture binary (`ETag` + `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`; returns `304 Not Modified` when `If-None-Match` matches)
- `GET /api/profile/picture/{personId}` (authorized) — get mechanic profile picture binary by person id (403 unless caller is admin or requesting own personId; 404 if mechanic/picture missing; `ETag` + `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`; returns `304 Not Modified` when `If-None-Match` matches)
- `GET /api/profile/picture/updates` (authorized) — SSE stream for realtime profile-picture updates (`profile-picture-updated` events), backed by bounded per-subscriber channels (max 200 subscriptions globally, max 5 subscriptions per user, buffer size 32, drop-oldest overflow mode)
- `PUT /api/profile/picture` (authorized, multipart/form-data) — upload profile picture (JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 512 KB, file bound from form payload). Server validates image magic bytes and rejects MIME/content mismatches.
- `DELETE /api/profile/picture` (authorized) — remove profile picture
- Group root endpoints are mapped without requiring a trailing slash (for example, `/api/profile` works directly).

## Admin Endpoints (Current)

- `GET /api/admin/mechanics` (authorized, AdminOnly policy) — list all mechanics with admin flag and `hasProfilePicture`; uses a Select projection to avoid materializing `ProfilePicture` blobs in the query
- `DELETE /api/admin/mechanics/{id}` (authorized, AdminOnly policy) — delete a mechanic (revokes refresh tokens, removes identity + domain record). Deletion invariants run in a serializable transaction and returns 403 if target is an admin or if caller tries to delete themselves, 422 if deleting the mechanic would leave zero mechanics globally or leave any appointment without an assigned mechanic, 409 on serialization/deadlock/concurrency contention, and 500 if linked Identity user deletion fails (no partial-success response).

## API Documentation

- OpenAPI spec: `GET /openapi/v1.json` (Development only)
- Interactive docs: Scalar API Reference at `/scalar/v1` (Development only)
- Package: `Scalar.AspNetCore` — modern replacement for Swagger UI, works with built-in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`.
- Endpoint mapper registrations declare explicit OpenAPI response metadata (`Produces`, `ProducesProblem`, `ProducesValidationProblem`) so status/body documentation in OpenAPI/Scalar stays accurate without changing runtime behavior.

## Security Middleware (must preserve order)

`UseHsts` (non-Dev) → `UseForwardedHeaders` → `UseHttpsRedirection` → security headers middleware → login ban middleware → `UseRateLimiter` → `UseCors` → `AuditAccessDeniedMiddleware` → `UseAuthentication` → `UseAuthorization`

Security headers middleware adds `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and API-focused `Content-Security-Policy` headers. In Development, CSP is skipped for `/openapi` and `/scalar` routes so API docs tooling can load.

Login-ban middleware remains in-process and uses deterministic cleanup scheduling (30-second interval) plus a max tracked-client bound (5000) to cap memory growth.

`AuditAccessDeniedMiddleware` is registered between `UseCors` and `UseAuthentication` so it wraps the full auth pipeline and can observe the final response status code on the way out. It logs a structured `LogWarning` under logger category `Auth.AccessDenied` for any `401` or `403` response, including the structured properties `StatusCode`, `MechanicId` (from the `person_id` claim, null when unauthenticated), `Method`, `Path`, and hashed `ClientIp` (`sha256:<12hex>`).

## Configuration

- Connection string key: `ConnectionStrings:AutoServiceDb`
- JWT keys: `JwtSettings:Secret` (min 32 bytes), `JwtSettings:Issuer`, `JwtSettings:Audience`
- Startup fails fast if `ConnectionStrings:AutoServiceDb` or `JwtSettings:Secret` contains template placeholder markers (for example `CHANGE_ME` or `SET_UNIQUE_LOCAL`).
- Outside Development, startup fails fast if `AllowedHosts` is missing/empty or contains wildcard (`*`) or `localhost`.
- CORS allowed origins key: `Cors:AllowedOrigins` (explicit origins, `AllowCredentials()` enabled, restricted methods `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE`, restricted headers `Content-Type`; current API appsettings default is `https://localhost:5173`)
- Forwarded-header trust config: `ForwardedHeaders:ForwardLimit`, `ForwardedHeaders:KnownProxies`, `ForwardedHeaders:KnownNetworks`
- Local overrides: `appsettings.Local.json` (gitignored) or env vars (`ConnectionStrings__AutoServiceDb`, `JwtSettings__Secret`)
- Never commit secrets or credentials.
- For AI-assisted database validation, use `ai_agent_test_user` and execute read-only `SELECT` queries only; never run DML/DDL (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER`, `CREATE`, `DROP`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`) from AI SQL tooling.

## Code Layout

- `Program.cs` — service registration, middleware, endpoint mapping only. Calls `builder.AddServiceDefaults()` at the top and `app.MapDefaultEndpoints()` last.
- `Auth/` — auth endpoint and security files split into subfolders: `Auth/Endpoints/` (map/register/login/helpers/contracts/logout/validate/refresh/phone-normalization) and `Auth/Security/` (JwtTokenIssuer, TokenDenylistService). `Auth/Session/` holds `AuthCookieNames`.
- `Appointments/` — appointment endpoint files (contracts/helpers/queries/mutations/registration), partial-class pattern mirroring `Auth/`.
- `Profile/` — profile endpoint files (contracts/helpers/queries/mutations/profilepicture), partial-class pattern mirroring `Appointments/`.
- `Admin/` — admin endpoint files (map/contracts/handlers), partial-class pattern. Mechanic list + delete.
- `Customers/` — customer endpoint files (CustomerEndpoints.cs/Contracts/Queries/Mutations), partial-class pattern.
- `Vehicles/` — vehicle endpoint files (VehicleEndpoints.cs/Contracts/Queries/Mutations), partial-class pattern.
- `Configuration/` — startup configuration resolvers (`ConnectionStringResolver`, `JwtSettingsResolver`, `TemplateMarkerDetector`). `TemplateMarkerDetector` is a shared static helper used by both `JwtSettingsResolver` and `DemoDataInitializer` to detect unconfigured placeholder markers (`CHANGE_ME`, `SET_UNIQUE_LOCAL`, and punctuation-normalized variants) in secrets.
- `Middleware/` — custom middleware classes (`LoginBanMiddleware`, `AuditAccessDeniedMiddleware`).
- `Identity/`, `Linking/`, `Normalization/`, `Security/`, `Validation/` — grouped cross-cutting folders; keep contact normalization (`ContactNormalization`), name validation (`IsValidName`), token hash/expiry parsing (`TokenSecurity`), person-type resolution (`PersonTypeResolver`), image content-type detection (`ImageContentTypeDetector`), and shared validation error message constants (`ValidationMessages`) centralized here. Also contains `NameFieldsValidator` (centralized name-field validation with two entry points: `ValidateNames()` for dict-based error patterns used by auth register, and `GetNameError()` for early-return patterns used by customer, appointment, and profile endpoints) and `VehicleNumericValidation` (year/mileage/power/torque constants `MinYear`/`MaxYear`/`MaxMileageKm`/`MaxEnginePowerHp`/`MaxEngineTorqueNm` and helper methods `GetYearValidationError()`/`GetValidationError()` used by vehicle and appointment endpoints).
- `Domain/` and `Security/` — model locations; keep business entities under `Domain/`, security entities under `Security/`, and unique value-object types under `Domain/UniqueTypes/`. `Security/ExpiredTokenCleanupService.cs` is a `BackgroundService` registered via `AddHostedService<ExpiredTokenCleanupService>()` that runs every hour to delete expired rows from `revokedjwttokens` and expired+revoked rows from `refreshtokens`, preventing unbounded table growth.
- Cross-cutting logic in dedicated folders/files; keep `Program.cs` clean.
- Keep comments concise and only for non-obvious logic.
